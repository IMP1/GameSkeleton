# GameSkeleton

A Java framework for game development. 
It uses a set of Java classes I made to handle Window creation, Graphical drawing, Input handling and other things.

It also has other classes/modules that can be used across different games. 
They don't all have to be used, and they should be (excluding the jog package) self-contained, so you can just delete ones you don't want.

But I also intend to add more usefule moduley things.

I'm testing it out with [GameFlesh](https://github.com/IMP1/GameFlesh), which is going to be a dungeon crawler type thing.
