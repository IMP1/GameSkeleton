# GameSkeleton

## Overview

GameSkeleton is a Java framework I've made for my game development.
It uses Java classes for Window creation, Graphical rendering, Input Handling and whatnot.
These are all contained in the `jog` package, which has what I consider to be the necessities for a game.

Is uses a couple of 3rd-party libraries. Primarily [EasyOGG]() (and [Jogg]() and [Jorbis]()) for using .ogg files for audio.

There are also other modules I've made that would be used across multiple game, but not necessarily in every game, as opposed to the `jog` package.

I'm testing it out with [GameFlesh](https://github.com/IMP1/GameFlesh), which is going to be a dungeon crawler type thing.
